# Creation of SFX targets in ExLibris SFX Knowledge Base

To ease the activations of National Licences in SFX, dedicated targets have been created in the SFX Knowledge Base. They will be maintained in the future by the Swissbib team.

You can find them in SFX under the top target `SWISS_CONSORTIUM_ACADEMIC_LIBRARIES`.

The process is the following :

 1. Create KBART title lists
 2. Upload them to Ex Libris Ftp server `ftp.exlibris.co.il` (login and password in Swissbib password safe)
 3. The update is then automatic
 4. It is very important that the file names remain consistent, so that the update is automatic :
    - cambridge_Switzerland_NationalLicences_<date>.txt
    - gruyter_Switzerland_NationalLicences_<date>.txt
    - oxford_Switzerland_NationalLicences_<date>.txt
 5. If there are any changes to the title lists we are using or new targets in the future, please either open a Salesforce case or write to: Ex Libris Data Services <Exlibris.Data.Services@exlibrisgroup.com>
 6. All details are in [Salesforce case 00218366](https://exlibrisgroup.my.salesforce.com/50032000010TMj3). The case has been published in Salesforce, therefore all ExLibris Customers can read it.
